# Icon generator

## THIS PACKAGE IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED ##

This package will generate an icon font from a directory of SVG files. There are some requirements for the SVG files before they can be processed:
 
Each filename should conform to:

    NUMBER_NAME(optional comma-delimited keywords).svg
    
The (decimal) number will be used to calculate the codepoint from the base codepoint that was chosen for the icon font.
